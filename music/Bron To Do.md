#### 我的使命

I was born to do

我 我 我的使命

I   I   I was born to do

 

我的使命

I was born to do

我 我 我的使命

I   I   I was born to do

我一直站在此处

I've been standing right here

整夜把自己锁在房间

Locked in this room all through the night

不把真想吐露

Trying to lie

我知道你们都不想死

Every person that never wanna die

但这是场战争 

It's been a fight

一场伟大的狗屁战争

Just to make US "GREAT" again in revolution

为了你我的"和平"我们必须开枪

Shooting for equality for you and me

更不用提

Not to mention

你的性命一文不值

Ain't got a dollar to your life

别再相信那些空话

Just give up the nonsense

昂首挺胸

Stand straight up

为"自己"拼命

o mere shame

在恐惧中流行，却渴望能带来和平

Protest int the fears, hoping to bring peace

这番情形，我在梦里也不是没见过

Cause I'm wanting it so bad I'm seeing it in my dreams

用枪火勾画一幅"胜景"

Get a gun and paint a picture

艰难地一步步爬上楼梯

Of the pain and pull the ladder

冒着那枪林弹雨，唇枪舌剑

Of this pitter patter, people poking jabs

这都不算什么

Oh well, It doesn't matter

因为这些痛苦都是暂时的

Cause this hurt won't all be forever

我从不停止憧憬未来

I'm keeping my head high

坚信我有辉煌时刻

And  hoping for the better when

即使事与愿违，轰我下台也不退却

Everything's down and out, under the weather

我这样都能拉到选票

And every first round you're out

你也拿我没辙

Stuck in the shredder

我可没说过所有人都能享有公平

Claim to have fair

而你说的公平也不会降临

But they're never around

我依然能独自笑到下一个任期

So I keep moving on, one man and a crowd

这是我的面孔

This is my face

这是我的街景

This is my street

这是我的肤色

This is my race

这是我的和平

This is my peace

这就是我的使命

This is what I was born to do

我的使命

I was born to do

每个人都哭喊

Everyone cries

每个人都欢庆

Everyone cheers

每个人都奋斗

Everyone fights

每个人都公平

Everyone fair

这就是我的使命

This is what I was born to do

我的使命

I was born to do



上天派我来此游戏

This is what I'm made for

我知道有人被警徽鄙夷

Every single moment that I'm living I can feel it from the cop force

你从未知晓属于真想的哪怕一隅

You don't know the half of half of what I've given

累积到如今的程度，是我们最痛的领悟

To pile it to this level, every day at home hurting

向主哭诉吧，因为总有人无故走上绝路

Every day laone wishing, while someone keep on dying

寒风愈加萧萧，哽咽的我们更清楚

And every cold wind is getting heavy, US choking

每一天都可能是你的最后一次呼吸

Every day, maybe your last chance to breathe

每天我都在破旧的窗子后面看这"美丽的风景线"

Every day I'm seeing better view on the window side

不安的喘息和嘶吼一如往常

Grasp and get anxious, shout like it's ancient

出动国民警卫我也在所不辞

Give them something that They've never heard from the citizens

站直了

Show me waht you're made of

我来看看你们几斤几两

Just tell'me straight up

你们当然可以继续横行街头

You can go and take on the world

因为你们已无法无天

What you afraid of?

没错，一切都变得疯狂

Yes, It's right around the bend

战斗的号角已经吹响，这才只是个开始

It's a first round knockout, let the rounds begin

倒计时是懦夫的恐慌，取胜是美利坚的宪章

No need to count to ten, we can count the win

你就等着瞧我称霸战场

And you can count on me to knock out every sound I'm in 

这是我的面孔

This is my face

这是我的街景

This is my street

这是我的肤色

This is my race

这是我的和平

This is my peace

这就是我的使命

This is what I was born to do

我的使命
